curl -X POST http://localhost      --data-binary "@/home/luis/proyects/webserv/images/image.jpeg" #sends images just as post, not other http info on the body

curl -F "image=@/home/luis/proyects/webserv/images/image.jpg" localhost -v #sends image as webbrowser displayable, so it has some http on the file itself.
